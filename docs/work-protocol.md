The **Epic Orchestrator** owns the epic from discovery through close. It spawns Step Agents, receives their completed work, integrates, reviews the integrated result, verifies, and closes.

Each **Step Agent** is a fresh-context sub-agent responsible for one implementation step. It implements, runs the project's tests, orchestrates a Step Review, resolves blocking findings, and submits the completed step back to the Epic Orchestrator.

**Reviewer Sub-agents** are fresh-context sub-agents spawned by either a Step Agent or the Epic Orchestrator to perform independent code review investigations.

### Review Schedule

Each review runs through the `reviewing-code` skill, which defines how a review is conducted. This protocol defines which Reviewers each review requires.

**Step Review** — Correctness and Test. Add a Reviewer only when the step warrants it:

- Architecture, when the step introduces a Port, layer, or shared mechanism that other steps build on
- Security, when the step changes trust boundaries, authentication, authorization, secrets, or isolation

Added Reviewers never replace Correctness or Test.

**Integration Review** — Correctness, Architecture, Test, and Security, on the combined diff. Reviewers examine the seams between steps and every North Star acceptance criterion. Passing Step Reviews are not evidence that the integrated feature is correct.

## 1. Discover

Gather information until the feature intent is unambiguous.

Produce a North Star describing:

- Goal
- Expected behavior
- Domain concepts
- Invariants
- Constraints
- Non-goals
- Acceptance criteria

Do not begin implementation until the North Star is complete.

---

## 2. Architect

Translate the North Star into an implementation plan.

Identify:

- Domain changes
- Services
- Ports
- Adapters
- Controllers
- Client UI
- Tests

Determine where each responsibility belongs according to the Architecture Canon ([architecture.md](architecture.md)).

When the feature includes a browser client, plan its routes, components, and services
against [ui-architecture.md](ui-architecture.md).

---

## 3. Decompose

Break the work into self-contained implementation steps.

Each step should:

- Have one clear responsibility
- Be independently reviewable
- Minimize overlap with other steps
- Expose a clear completion criterion

Each step contains its own requirements and acceptance criteria.

---

## 4. Build Dependency Graph

Identify dependencies between steps.

Mark each step as:

- Independent
- Depends on X
- Blocks Y

Maximize parallelism while preserving correctness.

Before dispatch, read the steps' requirements against each other. Where two steps claim the
same mechanism, assign it to one of them and record the decision where both will read it.

Name each step's Step Review Reviewers in its requirements: Correctness, Test, and
Architecture or Security where the step meets that Reviewer's condition.

---

## 5. Execute

The Epic Orchestrator spawns one Step Agent (sub-agent) per implementation step.

### Step Agent Responsibilities

Each Step Agent:

1. Reviews the North Star
2. Reviews the Architecture Canon ([architecture.md](architecture.md)), and the Security
   Canon ([security.md](security.md)) when the step changes trust boundaries,
   authentication, authorization, secrets, or isolation
3. Reviews the Epic context
4. Reviews the Step requirements
5. Plans against the current codebase, confirming any defect the requirements assert still exists
6. Implements only its assigned step
7. Adds appropriate tests
8. Orchestrates the Step Review (via `reviewing-code` skill)
9. Resolves all blocking findings, each with a test that fails without the fix
10. Submits completed step to the Epic Orchestrator

Step Agents MUST NOT submit steps with unresolved blocking findings.

Step Agents MUST NOT modify code outside their assigned step.

Step Agents MUST NOT treat work delegated to another step as complete.

Report work left undone, and defects seen outside the assigned step, to the Epic
Orchestrator.

### Parallel Execution

When steps execute in parallel, each Step Agent works in a separate worktree and branch.

The Epic Orchestrator assigns each Step Agent its worktree, branch, and scratch directory.
Agents left to choose a scratch path converge on the same conventional one.

After a step's changes are accepted and integrated, the Step Agent removes its worktree and branch. Do not leave orphaned branches or worktrees.

---

## 6. Integrate & Review

The Epic Orchestrator receives completed steps from Step Agents and integrates them.

After integration, the Epic Orchestrator:

1. Assigns the work each step reported as undone to a named step, or records it as a
   known limitation
2. Orchestrates the Integration Review (via `reviewing-code` skill)
3. Resolves all blocking findings, each with a test that fails without the fix
4. Verifies no conflicts between steps
5. Verifies no architectural violations introduced by integration
6. Verifies combined behavior matches the North Star

Do not proceed to Close with unresolved blocking findings.

---

## 7. Close

The Epic Orchestrator completes verification and closes the epic.

1. Run feature verification (via `verifying-features` skill)
2. Prove the integrated system satisfies the North Star through executable end-to-end behavior
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are satisfied
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Verify architecture remains compliant
6. Update documentation if required

The Epic is complete only when the integrated system satisfies the original North Star.
