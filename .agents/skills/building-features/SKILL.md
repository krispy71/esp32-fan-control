# Building Features

Use this skill when implementing a new feature or changing application structure. Work
proceeds from the inside outward — Domain first, transport and vendors last — with a
required plan before implementation and a completion audit before completing the change.

Read [docs/architecture.md](../../../docs/architecture.md) and follow it directly. It is
the single source of truth for:

- The mandatory dependency rules for Domain, Services, Services.Ports, Repositories,
  Adapters, Controller, and Utilities
- The Feature Construction Procedure
- The Complexity Controls (prohibited patterns)
- The Required Agent Plan, produced before implementation
- The Required Completion Audit, verified before completing the change

Apply its MUST / SHOULD / MAY requirements exactly as written.

When the feature includes a browser client, also use the
[building-ui](../building-ui/SKILL.md) skill.
[docs/architecture.md](../../../docs/architecture.md) governs the boundary between the
client and the backend; [docs/ui-architecture.md](../../../docs/ui-architecture.md)
governs everything inside the client.

When the work changes trust boundaries, authentication, authorization, secrets, or
isolation, also follow [docs/security.md](../../../docs/security.md). Build security in
from the start rather than relying on review to find its absence.
